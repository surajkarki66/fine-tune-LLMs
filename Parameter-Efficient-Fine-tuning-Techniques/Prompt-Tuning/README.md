# Prompt Tuning
## Overview
- Prompt tuning is the practice of customizing LLMs for new applications by adjusting a limited subset of parameters, known as prompts.
- These prompts, placed before the input, navigate the LLM toward producing the intended output.

## How does it work?
- `Understanding the Model:` Before engaging in prompt tuning, it’s crucial to have a solid understanding of the language model being used. Knowing the model’s architecture, strengths, and limitations helps in crafting effective prompts.
- `Initial Prompt Design:` The process typically begins with creating an initial prompt for a specific task or query. This prompt serves as the input to the language model, and the generated output is analyzed for relevance and accuracy.
- `Fine-Tuning Parameters:` Some language models allow users to adjust parameters such as temperature or sampling techniques. These parameters influence the diversity and creativity of the model’s responses. Fine-tuning these parameters can be part of the prompt tuning process.
- `Monitoring and Evaluation:` Throughout the prompt tuning process, it’s important to establish a robust monitoring and evaluation system. This involves systematically assessing the quality of generated outputs, identifying patterns of errors, and using this information to guide further adjustments to the prompts.
- `Incorporating Human Feedback:` Human feedback plays a vital role in prompt tuning. Users can evaluate the model’s responses, gather feedback from end-users, and use this feedback to refine and improve prompts over time. This human-in-the-loop approach contributes to the continuous enhancement of model performance.
